1. line 9 prints 20 since add is true
   
2. line 13 should also print 20 since var has scope function and it was modified earlier. 
   
3. line 9 will print 20 as the result is still within in the if block and let has block scope
   
4. it will give an error since the variable is not accessible outside the if block 

5. the code returns error as result cannot be reassigned value once its been declared and initialized 

6. the code returns an error again for the same reason as question 4
